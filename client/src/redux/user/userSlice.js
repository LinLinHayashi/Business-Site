/* Action creators and reducers:
1. ".actions" attribute of "userSlice" is an automatically generated object that contains action creators.
2. Action creators have the same names as the reducers and can be used to dispatch actions with the corresponding action types.
3. "userSlice.actions" will look like this:
   {
    signInStart: createAction('user/signInStart'),
    signInSuccess: createAction('user/signInSuccess'),
    signInFailure: createAction('user/signInFailure)
   }
